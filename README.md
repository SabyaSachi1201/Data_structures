# Data_structures
This Repository contains basic implementations of primary data structures (Queues, List, Stacks). Will be adding more here soon. The goal of creating this repository is : 1. Have reliable , available data structure code written by me, for any reference.  2. Have a good idea regarding the code modulation.
